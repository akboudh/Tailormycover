# Privacy Policy for TailorMyCover

**Last Updated:** November 22, 2025

## 1. Introduction
TailorMyCover ("we", "our", or "us") is a Chrome Extension designed to help users generate tailored cover letters using Artificial Intelligence. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage
We do **not** collect, store, or share any of your personal data on our own servers. All data processing happens locally on your device or via direct communication with the OpenAI API.

### Types of Data We Handle:
*   **Personal Information:** Your resume text (which may include your name, address, email, and phone number) is stored locally in your browser's storage (`chrome.storage.local`) to facilitate the generation of cover letters.
*   **Authentication Information:** Your OpenAI API Key is stored locally on your device to authenticate requests to OpenAI.
*   **Website Content:** The extension reads the text of the job description from the active browser tab when you click "Generate".

## 3. Data Sharing
We do not sell or share your data with third parties, with the sole exception of the necessary data transfer to **OpenAI** to perform the core service.
*   **OpenAI:** When you generate a cover letter, your Resume Text, the Job Description, and your System Prompt are sent directly from your browser to the OpenAI API. This interaction is governed by [OpenAI's Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy).

## 4. Data Security
*   Your API Key and Resume are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's secure storage API.
*   We do not have access to your API key or your personal data.

## 5. User Control
You have full control over your data. You can update or delete your stored resume and API key at any time through the extension's Options page. Removing the extension from Chrome will delete all locally stored data.
